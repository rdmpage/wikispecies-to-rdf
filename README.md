# Wikispecies to RDF

Parse Wikispecies pages and convert to RDF using [schema.org](https://schema.org) vocabulary. Goal is to have Wikispecies in a structured form that can be used to do things such as help map Wikispecies to Wikidata, extract author - publication links for use in Wikidata, and as a source of bibliographic metadata to locate articles in BioStor.
